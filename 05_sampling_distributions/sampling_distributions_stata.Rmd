In this lab, we investigate the ways in which the statistics from a random 
sample of data can serve as point estimates for population parameters. We're 
interested in formulating a *sampling distribution* of our estimate in order 
to learn about the properties of the estimate, such as its distribution.

**Setting a seed:** We will take some random samples and build sampling distributions
in this lab, which means you should set a seed on top of your do-file. If this concept
is new to you, review the lab concerning probability.

## Getting Started


### The data

We consider real estate data from the city of Ames, Iowa. The details of 
every real estate transaction in Ames is recorded by the City Assessor's 
office. Our particular focus for this lab will be all residential home sales 
in Ames between 2006 and 2010.  This collection represents our population of 
interest. In this lab we would like to learn about these home sales by taking 
smaller samples from the full population. Let's load the data into Stata.


```{r global-options, include=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(oilabs)
library(haven)
data(ames)
dat = ames
dat = as.data.frame(dat)
colnames(dat) = gsub("[.]", "_", colnames(dat))
write_dta(data = dat, path = "ames.dta", version = 13)

library(statamd)
statapath = statamd::stata_engine_path()
profile_do(dataset = "ames.dta")

knitr::opts_chunk$set(eval = FALSE, engine = "stata", 
    engine.path = statapath, comment = "")
```

```{r load-data}
use "ames.dta"
```

We see that there are quite a few variables in the data set, enough to do a 
very in-depth analysis. For this lab, we'll restrict our attention to just 
two of the variables: the above ground living area of the house in square feet 
(`area`) and the sale price (`price`).

We can explore the distribution of areas of homes in the population of home
sales visually and with summary statistics. Let's first create a visualization,
a histogram:

```{r area-hist, echo = 1, results = "hide"}
histogram area
# graph export area.png, replace
# ![](area.png)
```



Let's also obtain some summary statistics. Note that we can do this using the
`summarze` function. 

```{r summ-area}
summarize area
```

If we add the option `detail`, we can obtain more information.  New information given with the `detail` option are quantiles, 
values corresponding to specific percentile cutoffs in the distribution. For
example, the 25th percentile (Q1)
in the distribution of `area`. Finding these values is useful for describing the 
distribution, as we can use them for descriptions like *"the middle 50% of the 
homes have areas between such and such square feet"*.

```{r area-stats}
summarize area, detail
```

1.  Describe this population distribution using a visualization and these summary
    statistics. You don't have to use all of the summary statistics in your 
    description, you will need to decide which ones are relevant based on the
    shape of the distribution. Make sure to include the plot and the summary
    statistics output in your report along with your narrative.

## The unknown sampling distribution

In this lab we have access to the entire population, but this is rarely the 
case in real life. Gathering information on an entire population is often 
extremely costly or impossible. Because of this, we often take a sample of 
the population and use that to understand the properties of the population.

Before we do this, we need to discuss the concept of `preserve` in Stata.  In Stata, we can only work with one dataset at a time.  We want to work with a sample from the full `ames` dataset, but we would also like to return to the full dataset later on.  Therefore, we will "preserve" the full `ames` dataset before moving forward by using the `preserve` command.  

```{r preserve}
preserve
```

Remember, we can also always read back in the original dataset with the command `use "ames.dta"` if we want to return to the full data.  However, the `preserve` command makes this a bit easier.

If we were interested in estimating the mean living area in Ames based on a 
sample, we can use the `sample` command to survey the population.

```{r samp1}
sample 50, count
```

This command collects a simple random sample of size 50 from the `ames` dataset, and discards the remaining data. Sampling is like going into the City 
Assessor's database and pulling up the files on 50 random home sales. Working 
with these 50 files would be considerably simpler than working with all 2930 
home sales.

1.  Describe the distribution of area in this sample. How does it compare to the 
    distribution of the population? **Hint:** the `sample` function takes a random
    sample of observations (i.e. rows) from the dataset, you can still refer to 
    the variables in the dataset with the same names. Code you used in the 
    previous exercise will also be helpful for visualizing and summarizing the sample.

If we're interested in estimating the average living area in homes in Ames 
using the sample, our best single guess is the sample mean.

```{r mean-samp1}
summarize area
```

Depending on which 50 homes you selected, your estimate could be a bit above 
or a bit below the true population mean of 1499.69 square feet. In general, 
though, the sample mean turns out to be a pretty good estimate of the average 
living area, and we were able to get it by sampling less than 3\% of the 
population.

1.  Would you expect the mean of your sample to match the mean of another team's 
    sample? Why, or why not? If the answer is no, would you expect the means to
    just be somewhat different or very different? Ask a neighboring team to confirm 
    your answer.

1.  Take a second sample, also of size 50. How does the 
    mean of this new sample compare with the mean of your original sample? Suppose we took two 
    more samples, one of size 100 and one of size 1000. Which would you think 
    would provide a more accurate estimate of the population mean?  **Hint:** Use the `restore, preserve` command below to return to the original, full dataset before sampling again.
    
```{r restore-preserve}
restore, preserve
```

Not surprisingly, every time we take another random sample, we get a different 
sample mean. It's useful to get a sense of just how much variability we 
should expect when estimating the population mean this way. The distribution 
of sample means, called the *sampling distribution (of the mean)*, can help us understand 
this variability. In this lab, because we have access to the population, we 
can build up the sampling distribution for the sample mean by repeating the 
above steps many times. 

Here we will generate 15,000 samples and compute the 
sample mean of each. Note that we use `bootstrap` instead of `sample` to sample with replacement and compute the sample mean of each sample.  This is because sampling distributions are constructed by sampling
with replacement.  

```{r loop}
restore, preserve
bootstrap stat=r(mean), saving("sample.dta", replace) size(50) reps(15000): summarize area
```

Here we use Stata to take 15,000 different samples of size 50 from the population.  We know this because the `reps` specifies 15,000 and the `size` specifies 50.  We then calculate 
the mean of each sample, and store each result in a dataset called `sample.dta`. Next, we review how this set of code works.

1.  How many elements are there in `sample.dta`?  Describe the sampling 
    distribution, and be sure to specifically note its center. Make sure to include 
    a plot of the distribution in your answer.  **Hint:** Be sure to read in the newly created dataset, `sample.dta`.

## Interlude: Sampling distributions

The idea behind the `bootstrap` function is *repetition*. Earlier we took
a single sample of size `n` (50) from the population of all houses in Ames. With
this new function we are able to repeat this sampling procedure 15,000 times in order
to build a distribution of a series of sample statistics, which is called the 
**sampling distribution**. 

Note that in practice one rarely gets to build true sampling distributions, 
because we rarely have access to data from the entire population. 

Without the `bootstrap` function, this would be painful. We would have to 
manually run the following code 15,000 times: 

```{r sample-code, eval=FALSE}
sample 50, count
summarize area
```

as well as store the resulting sample means each time in a separate dataset

Note that for each of the 15,000 times we computed a mean, we did so from a 
**different** sample!

1.  To make sure you understand how sampling distributions are built, and exactly
    what the `bootstrap` function does, try modifying the code to create a
    sampling distribution of **25 sample means** from **samples of size 10**, 
    and put them in a dataset named `sample_means_small.dta`. Look at the Data Editor. 
    How many observations are there in this dataset called `sample_means_small`? 
    What does each observation represent?

## Sample size and the sampling distribution

Mechanics aside, let's return to the reason we used the `bootstrap` function: to 
compute a sampling distribution, specifically, the sampling distribution of the 
mean home area for samples of 50 houses. 

```{r hist}
use "sample.dta", clear
histogram stat
```

The sampling distribution that we computed tells us much about estimating 
the average living area in homes in Ames.  Because the sample mean is an 
unbiased estimator, the sampling distribution is centered at the true average 
living area of the population, and the spread of the distribution 
indicates how much variability is incurred by sampling only 50 home sales.

In the remainder of this section we will work on getting a sense of the effect that 
sample size has on our sampling distribution.

1.  Use the app below to create sampling distributions of means of `area`s from
    samples of size 10, 50, and 100. Use 5,000 simulations. What does each 
    observation in the sampling distribution represent? How does the mean, standard
    error, and shape of the sampling distribution change as the sample size
    increases? How (if at all) do these values change if you increase the number 
    of simulations? (You do not need to include plots in your answer.)

## More Practice

So far, we have only focused on estimating the mean living area in homes in 
Ames. Now you'll try to estimate the mean home price.

You are expected to write the required code and produce the necessary plots and
summary statistics. 

<!-- You are welcome to use the app for exploration.
-->

1.  Take a sample of size 15 from the population and calculate the mean `price`
    of the homes in this sample. Using this sample, what is your best point estimate
    of the population mean of prices of homes?

1.  Since you have access to the population, simulate the sampling 
    distribution of $\overline{price}$ for samples of size 15 by taking 2000 
    samples from the population of size 15 and computing 2000 sample means. 
    Store these means 
    in a dataset called `sample_price.dta`. Plot the data, then describe the 
    shape of this sampling distribution. Based on this sampling distribution, 
    what would you guess the mean home price of the population to be? Finally, 
    calculate and report the population mean.

1.  Change your sample size from 15 to 150, then compute the sampling 
    distribution using the same method as above, and store these means in a 
    new dataset called `sample_means150.dta`. Describe the shape of this sampling 
    distribution, and compare it to the sampling distribution for a sample 
    size of 15. Based on this sampling distribution, what would you guess to 
    be the mean sale price of homes in Ames?

1.  Of the sampling distributions from Exercises 9 and 10, which has a smaller spread?  If
    we're concerned with making estimates that are more often close to the 
    true value, would we prefer a sampling distribution with a large or small spread?
